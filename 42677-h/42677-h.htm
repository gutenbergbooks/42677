            <span>The sleek machine that, day and night,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Fed with paper, virgin white,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Through those glaring, flaring hours</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>In the incandescent light,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Printed children's picture-books--</span>

            <span>Red and yellow, blue and green,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With sunny fields and running brooks,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Ships at sea, and golden sands,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Queer white towns in Eastern lands,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Tossing palms on coral strands--</span>
          </div>

            <span>Until at times the clank and whirr and click,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And shimmer of white paper turned him sick;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And though at first the colours made him glad,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>They soon were dancing in his brain like mad;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And kept on flaring through his burning head:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Now, in a flash, the workshop, flaming red;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Now blazing green; now staring blue;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And then the yellow glow too well he knew:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Until the sleek machine, with roar and glare,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Began to take him in a dazzling snare;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>When, fascinated, with a senseless stare,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>It drew him slowly towards it, till his hair</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Was caught betwixt the rollers; but his hand,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Almost before his brain could understand,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Had clutched the lever; and the wheels were stopped</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Just in the nick of time; though now he dropped,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Half-senseless on the littered workshop floor:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And he'd lain dazed a minute there or more,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>When his machine-girl helped him to a seat.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But soon again he was upon his feet,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And tending that unsatisfied machine;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And printing pictures, red and blue and green,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Until again the green and blue and red</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Went jigging in a riot through his head;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, wildest of the raging rout,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The blinding, screeching, racking yellow--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>A crazy devil of a fellow--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>O'er all the others seemed to shout.</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>For hands must not be idle when the year</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Is getting through, and Christmas drawing near,</span>

            <span>To laugh, to sing, to whistle, or to talk ...</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>If only, through his brain, unceasingly,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The wheels would not keep whirring, while the smell--</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>The oily smell of thick and sticky glaze</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Clung to his nostrils, till 'twas hard to tell</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>If he were really out in the fresh air;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And still before his eyes, the blind, white glare,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And then the colours dancing in his head,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>A maddening maze of yellow, blue and red.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>So, on he wandered in a kind of daze,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Too racked with sleeplessness to think of bed</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Save as a hell, where you must toss and toss,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With colours shooting in insane criss-cross</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Before wide, prickling, gritty, sleepless eyes.</span>

        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>But, as he walked along the darkening street,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Too tired to rest, and far too spent to eat,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The swish and patter of the passing feet,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The living, human murmur, and keen cries,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The deep, cool shadows of the coming night,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>About quick-kindling jets of clustered light;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And the fresh breathing of the rain-washed air,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Brought something of sweet healing to his mind;</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>And, though he trailed along as if half-blind,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Yet often on the pavement he would stop</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To gaze at goods displayed within a shop;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And wonder, in a dull and lifeless way,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>What they had cost, and who'd the price to pay.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But those two kinds of shop which, as a boy,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Had been to him a never-failing joy,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The bookshop and the fruitshop, he passed by,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>As if their colours seared his wincing eye;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>For still he feared the yellow, blue and red</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Would start that devils' dancing in his head.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And soon, through throngs of people, almost gay</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To be let loose from work, he pushed his way;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And ripples of their careless laughter stole</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Like waves of cooling waters through his soul,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>While sometimes he would lift his aching eyes,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And see a child's face, flushed with proud surprise,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>As, gripping both its parents' hands quite tight,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>It found itself in fairylands of light,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Walking with grown-up people through the night:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Then, turning, with a shudder he would see</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Poor painted faces, leering frightfully,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And so drop back from heaven again to hell.</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>And then, somehow, though how he scarce could tell,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He found that he was walking through the throng,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Quite happy, with a young girl at his side--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>A young girl apple-cheeked and eager-eyed;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And her frank, friendly chatter seemed a song</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To him, who ne'er till now had heard life sing.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And youth within him kindled quick and strong,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>As he drank in that careless chattering.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And now she told to him how she had come</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>From some far Northern Isle to earn her bread;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And in a stuffy office all day long,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>In shiny ledgers, with a splitting head,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>She added dazzling figures till they danced,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And tied themselves in wriggling knots, and pranced,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And scrambled helter-skelter o'er the page:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, though it seemed already quite an age</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Since she had left her home, from end to end</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Of this big town she had not any friend:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>At times she almost dreaded she'd go dumb,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With not a soul to speak to; for, at home</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>In her own Island, she knew everyone...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>No strangers there! save when the tinkers came,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With pots and pans aglinting in the sun--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>You saw the tin far off, like glancing flame,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>As all about the Island they would roam....</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Then, of themselves at home, there were six brothers,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Five sisters, with herself, besides the others--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Two homeless babes, whom, having lost their mothers,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Her mother'd taken in among her own...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And she in all her life had hardly known</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Her mother with no baby at her breast...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>She'd always sing to hush them all to sleep;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And sang, too, for the dancing, sang to keep</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The feet in time and tune; and still sang best,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Clean best of all the singers of the Isle.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And as she talked of home, he saw her smile,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With happy, far-off gaze; and then as though</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>In wonder how she'd come to chatter so</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To this pale, grave-eyed boy, she paused, half shy;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And then she laughed, with laughter clear and true;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And looked into his eyes; and he laughed too,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And they were happy, hardly knowing why.</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>And now he told her of his life, and how</span>
          </div>

            <span>Fierce pity cut her to the very quick;</span>

            <span>That last rough mile or so,</span>

            <span>And from the unseen fern,</span>

            <span>Grey ghost of all bewildered things,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Talk as I might, she would not go to bed,</span>

            <span>This long while: you'll be ready for your meat."</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With that he beckoned me to take a seat</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Before the table, lifting from the crook</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The singing kettle; while, with far-off look,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>As though she neither saw nor heard,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>His wife sat gazing at the glowing peat.</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>So, wondering sorely, I sat down to eat;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And yet she neither spoke, nor stirred;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But in her high-backed chair sat bolt-upright,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With still grey eyes; and tumbled hair, as white</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>As fairy-cotton, straggling o'er her brow,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And hung in wisps about her wasted cheek.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But, when I'd finished, and drew near the fire,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>She suddenly turned round to speak,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Her old eyes kindling with a tense desire.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Her words came tremblingly: "You'll tell me now</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>What news you bring of him, my son?" Amazed,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I met that searching and love-famished look:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And then the old man, seeing I was dazed,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Made shift to swing aside the kettle crook;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And muttered in my ear:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>"John Netherton, his name:" and as I gazed</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Into the peat that broke in clear blue flame,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Remembrance flashed upon me with the name;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And I slipped back in memory twenty year--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Back to the fo'c'sle of a villainous boat;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And once again in that hot hell I lay,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Watching the smoky lantern duck and sway,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>As though in steamy stench it kept afloat...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The fiery fangs of fever at my throat;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And my poor broken arm, ill-set,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>A bar of white-hot iron at my side:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, as I lay, with staring eyes pricked wide,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Throughout eternities of agony,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I saw a big, black shadow stoop o'er me;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And felt a cool hand touch my brow, and wet</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>My cracking lips: and sank in healing sleep:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And when I rose from that unfathomed deep,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I saw the youngest of that rascal crew</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Beside my bunk; and heard his name; and knew</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>'Twas he who'd brought me ease: but, soon, ashore,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>We parted; and I never saw him more;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Though, some while after, in another place,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I heard he'd perished in a drunken brawl...</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>And now the old man touched me, to recall</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>My wandering thoughts; and breathed again the name</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And I looked up into the mother's face</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>That burned before me with grey eyes aflame.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And so I told her how I'd met her son;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And of the kindly things that he had done.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And as I spoke her quivering spirit drank</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The news that it had thirsted for so long;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And for a flashing moment gay and strong</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Life flamed in her old eyes, then slowly sank.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>"And he was happy when you saw him last?"</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>She asked: and I was glad to answer, "Yes."</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Then all sat dreaming without stir or sound,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>As gradually she sank into the past,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With eyes that looked beyond all happiness,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Beyond all earthly trouble and distress,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Into some other world than ours. The thread</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>That long had held the straining life earthbound</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Was loosed at last: her eyes grew dark: her head</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Drooped slowly on her breast; and she was dead.</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>The old man at her side spoke not a word,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>As we arose, and bore her to the bed;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And laid her on the clean, white quilt at rest</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With calm hands folded on her quiet breast.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, hour by hour, he hardly even stirred,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Crouching beside me in the ingle-seat;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And staring, staring at the still red glow:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But, only when the fire was burning low,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He rose to bring fresh peat;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And muttered with dull voice and slow:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>"This fire has ne'er burned out through all these years--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Not since the hearthstone first was set--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And that is nigh two hundred year ago.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>My father's father built this house; and I...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I thought my son..." and then he gave a sigh;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And as he stooped, his wizened cheek was wet</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With slowly-trickling tears.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And now he hearkened, while an owl's keen cry</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Sang through the silence, as it fluttered nigh</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The cottage-window, dazzled by the light,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Then back, with fainter hootings, into night.</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>But, when the fresh peats broke into a blaze,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He watched it with a steady, dry-eyed gaze;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And spoke once more: "And he, dead, too!</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>You did not tell her; but I knew ... I knew!"</span>

        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>And now came all the tale of their distress:</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Their only son, in wanton waywardness,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Had left them, nearly thirty year ago;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And they had never had a word from him</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>In all that time... the reckless blow</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Of his unkindness struck his mother low...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Her hair, as ruddy as the fern</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>In late September by a moorland burn,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Had shrivelled rimy-white</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>In one short summer's night:</span>

            <span>His mother set for him at every meal,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>And kept his bed well-aired ... the knife and fork</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>I'd used were John's ... but, as all hope grew dim,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>She sickened, dwindling feebler every day:</span>

          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>She grew more confident that, ere she passed,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>A stranger would bring news to her, at last,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Of her lost son. "And when I woke in bed</span>

            <span>She turned to me, with sleepless eyes, and said:</span>

            <span>Which, unto me unknown,</span>

            <span>Had drawn me through long years, by such strange ways,</span>

            <span>Upon the white hearthstone:</span>

            <span>In either window. Waiting there, a while,</span>

            <span>And hubbub of the foundry: and my eyes,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Still tingling from the smoke, were glad to rest</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Upon the ordered shelves, so neatly dressed</span>

            <span>With careful step, across the upper floor:</span>

            <span>Swung open; and her husband hurried in.</span>

            <span>Was busy, when I ... Well, to tell the truth,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>They were in trouble, for their little son</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Had come in ill from school ... the doctor said</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Pneumonia ... they'd been putting him to bed:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Perhaps, I'd heard them, moving overhead,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>For boards would creak, and creak, for all your care.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>They hoped the best; for he was young; and youth</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Could come through much; and all that could be done</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Would be ... then he stood, listening, quite unnerved,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>As though he heard a footstep on the stair,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Though I heard nothing: but at my remark</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>About the fog and sleet, he turned,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And answered quickly, as there burned</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>In his brown eyes an eager flame:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The raw and damp were much to blame:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>If but his son might breathe West-country air!</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>A certain Cornish village he could name</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Was just the place; if they could send him there,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And only for a week, he'd come back stronger...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And then, again, he listened: and I took</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>My paper, and went, afraid to keep him longer;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And left him standing with that haggard look.</span>

        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>Next night, as I pushed in, there was no tinkle:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, glancing up, I saw the bell was gone;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Although, in either window, the gas shone;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And I was greeted by a cheery twinkle</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Of burnished tins and bottles from the shelves:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And now, I saw the father busy there</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Behind the counter, cutting with a string</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>A bar of soap up for a customer,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With weary eyes, and jerky, harassed air,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>As if his mind were hardly on the task:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And when 'twas done, and parcelled up for her,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And she had gone; he turned to me, and said:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He thought that folks might cut their soap themselves.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>'Twas nothing much ... but any little thing,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>At such a time ... And, having little doubt</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The boy was worse, I did not like to ask;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>So picked my paper up, and hurried out.</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, all next day, amid the glare and clang</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And clatter of the workshop, his words rang;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And kept on ringing, in my head a-ring;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But any little thing ... at such a time...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And kept on chiming to the anvils' chime:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But any little thing ... at such a time...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And they were hissed and sputtered in the sizzle</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Of water on hot iron: little thing...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>At such a time: and, when I left, at last,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The smoke and steam; and walked through the cold drizzle,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The lumbering of the 'buses as they passed</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Seemed full of it; and to the passing feet,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The words kept patter, patter, with dull beat.</span>

        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>I almost feared to turn into their street,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Lest I should find the blinds down in the shop:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, more than once, I'd half-a-mind to stop,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And buy my paper from the yelling boys,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Who darted all about with such a noise</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>That I half-wondered, in a foolish way,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>How they could shriek so, knowing that the sound</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Must worry children, lying ill in bed...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Then, thinking even they must earn their bread,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>As I earned mine, and scarce as noisily!</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I wandered on; and very soon I found</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I'd followed where my thoughts had been all day.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And stood before the shop, relieved to see</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The gases burning, and no window-blind</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Of blank foreboding. With an easier mind,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I entered slowly; and was glad to find</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The father by the counter, 'waiting me,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With paper ready and a cheery face.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Yes! yes! the boy was better ... took the turn,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Last night, just after I had left the place.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He feared that he'd been short and cross last night.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But, when a little child was suffering,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>It worried you ... and any little thing,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>At such a moment, made you cut up rough:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Though, now that he was going on all right...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Well, he'd have patience, now, to be polite!</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, soon as ever he was well enough,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The boy should go to Cornwall for a change--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Should go to his own home; for he, himself,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Was Cornish, born and bred, his wife as well:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And still his parents lived in the old place--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>A little place, as snug as snug could be...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Where apple-blossom dipped into the sea...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Perhaps, to strangers' ears, that sounded strange--</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>But not to any Cornishman who knew</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>How sea and land ran up into each other;</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>And how, all round each wide, blue estuary,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>The flowers were blooming to the waters' edge:</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>You'd come on blue-bells like a sea of blue...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But they would not be out for some while yet...</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>'Twould be primroses, blowing everywhere,</span>

          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>You'd never half-know what primroses were,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Unless you'd seen them growing in the West;</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>But, having seen, would never more forget.</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>When the sun shone upon them, after wet...</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>And his eyes sparkled, as he turned to sell</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>A penny loaf and half-an-ounce of tea</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To a poor child, who waited patiently,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>With hacking cough that tore her hollow chest:</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>He muttered to himself: It's strange, it's strange</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>That little ones should suffer so.... The light</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Had left his eyes: but, when he turned to me,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I saw a flame leap in them, hot and bright.</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>I'd like to take them all, he said, to-night!</span>

        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, in the workshop, all through the next day,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The anvils had another tune to play...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Primroses, and primroses, and primroses:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The bellows puffing out: It's strange, it's strange</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>That little ones should suffer so...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And now, my hammer, at a blow:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I'd like to take them all, to-night!</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, in the clouds of steam, and white-hot glow,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I seemed to see primroses everywhere,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Primroses, and primroses, and primroses.</span>

        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, each night after that, I heard the boy</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Was mending quickly; and would soon be well:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Till one night I was startled by the bell:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Tin-tinkle-tinkle-tinkle, loud and clear;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And tried to hush it, lest the lad should hear.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But, when the father saw me clutch the thing,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He said, the boy had missed it yesterday;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And wondered why he could not hear it ring;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And wanted it; and had to have his way.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And then, with brown eyes burning with deep joy,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He told me, that his son was going West--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Was going home ... the doctor thought, next week,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He'd be quite well enough: the way was long;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But trains were quick; and he would soon be there</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And on the journey he'd have every care,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>His mother being with him ... it was best,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>That she should go: for he would find it strange,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The little chap, at first ... she needed change...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, when they'd had a whiff of Western air!</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>'Twould cost a deal; and there was naught to spare</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But, what was money, if you hadn't health:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, what more could you buy, if you'd the wealth...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Yes! 'twould be lonely for himself, and rough;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Though, on the whole, he'd manage well enough:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He'd have a lot to do: and there was naught</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Like work to keep folk cheerful: when the hand</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Was busy, you had little time for thought;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And thinking was the mischief ... and 'twas grand</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To know that they'd be happy. Then the bell</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Went tinkle-tinkle; and he turned to sell.</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>One night he greeted me with face that shone,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Although the eyes were wistful; they were gone--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Had gone this morning, he was glad to say:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, though 'twas sore work, setting them away,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Still, 'twas the best for them ... and they would be</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Already in the cottage by the sea...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He spoke no more of them; but turned his head;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And said he wondered if the price of bread...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, as I went again into the night,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I saw his eyes were glistening in the light.</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, two nights after that, he'd got a letter:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And all was well: the boy was keeping better;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And was as happy as a child could be,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>All day with the primroses and the sea,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And pigs! Of all the wonders of the West,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>His mother wrote, he liked the pigs the best.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And now the father laughed until the tears</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Were in his eyes, and chuckled: Aye! he knew!</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Had he not been a boy there once, himself?</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He'd liked pigs, too, when he was his son's years.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And then, he reached a half-loaf from the shelf;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And twisted up a farthing's worth of tea,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And farthing's worth of sugar, for the child,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The same poor child who waited patiently,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Still shaken by a hacking, racking cough.</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, all next day, the anvils rang with jigs:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The bellows roared and rumbled with loud laughter,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Until it seemed the workshop had gone wild,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And it would echo, echo, ever after</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The tune the hammers tinkled on and off,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>A silly tune of primroses and pigs...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Of all the wonders of the West</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He liked the pigs, he liked the pigs the best!</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>Next night, as I went in, I caught</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>A strange, fresh smell. The postman had just brought</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>A precious box from Cornwall, and the shop</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Was lit with primroses, that lay atop</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>A Cornish pasty, and a pot of cream:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, as, with gentle hands, the father lifted</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The flowers his little son had plucked for him,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He stood a moment in a far-off dream,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>As though in glad remembrances he drifted</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>On Western seas: and, as his eyes grew dim,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He stooped, and buried them in deep, sweet bloom</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Till, hearing, once again, the poor child's cough,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He served her hurriedly, and sent her off,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Quite happily, with thin hands filled with flowers.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, as I followed to the street, the gloom</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Was starred with primroses; and many hours</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The strange, shy flickering surprise</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Of that child's keen, enchanted eyes</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Lit up my heart, and brightened my dull room.</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>Then, many nights the foundry kept me late</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With overtime; and I was much too tired</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To go round by the shop; but made for bed</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>As straight as I could go: until one night</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>We'd left off earlier, though 'twas after eight,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>I thought I'd like some news about the boy.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I found the shop untended; and the bell</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Tin-tinkle-tinkle-tinkled all in vain.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And then I saw, through the half-curtained pane,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The back-room was a very blaze of joy:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And knew the mother and son had come safe back.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, as I slipped away, now all was well,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I heard the boy shriek out, in shrill delight:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>"And, father, all the little pigs were black!"</span>

            <span>With blinded lantern, that all night</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>With wonder all too dread for words.</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Too big, by far, in my belief,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>For guillemot or shag--</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Like seamen sitting bolt-upright</span>

            <span>Upon a half-tide reef:</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Without a sound, or spurt of white.</span>

        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">

          <div class="line">
            <span>We landed; and made fast the boat;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And climbed the track in single file,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Each wishing he was safe afloat,</span>

            <span>On any sea, however far,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>So it be far from Flannan Isle:</span>

          <div class="line">

          <div class="line">
            <span>As though we'd lost all count of time,</span>

            <span>And so must climb for evermore.</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Yet, all too soon, we reached the door--</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>The black, sun-blistered lighthouse-door,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>That gaped for us ajar.</span>

        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">

          <div class="line">
            <span>We paused, we seemed to breathe the smell</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Of limewash and of tar,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>And so, yet wondering, side by side,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>We stood a moment, still tongue-tied:</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>And each with black foreboding eyed</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The door, ere we should fling it wide,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To leave the sunlight for the gloom:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Till, plucking courage up, at last,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Hard on each other's heels we passed,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>We only saw a table, spread</span>

            <span>As though, when they sat down to eat,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Lay tumbled on the floor.</span>

            <span>We set about our hopeless search.</span>

            <span>Had kindled underfoot and overhead:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Then, gripping tight his pick,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He rushed upon his brother:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But Robert, turning quick,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Leapt up, and now they faced each other.</span>

        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>They faced each other: Dick with arm upraised,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>In act to strike, and murder in his eyes....</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>When, suddenly, with noise of thunder,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The earth shook round them, rumbling o'er and under;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And Dick saw Robert, lying at his feet:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>As, close behind, the gallery crashed in:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And almost at his heel, earth gaped asunder.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>By black disaster dazed,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>His wrath died; and he dropped the pick;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And staggered, dizzily and terror-sick.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But, when the dust and din</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Had settled to a stillness, dread as death:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And he once more could draw his breath;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He gave a little joyful shout</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To find the lamps had not gone out.</span>

        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>And on his knees he fell</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Beside his brother, buried in black dust:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, full of tense misgiving,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He lifted him, and thrust</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>A knee beneath his head; and cleared</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The dust from mouth and nose: but could not tell</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Awhile if he were dead or living.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Too fearful to know what he feared,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He fumbled at the open shirt,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And felt till he could feel the heart,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Still beating with a feeble beat:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And then he saw the closed lids part,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And saw the nostrils quiver;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And knew his brother lived, though sorely hurt.</span>

        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>Again he staggered to his feet,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And fetched his water-can, and wet</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The ashy lips, and bathed the brow,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Until his brother sat up with a shiver,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And gazed before him with a senseless stare</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And dull eyes strangely set.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Too well Dick knew that now</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>They must not linger there,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Cut off from all their mates, to be o'ertaken</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>In less than no time by the deadly damp,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>So, picking up his lamp,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He made his brother rise;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Then took him by the arm,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And shook him, till he'd shaken</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>An inkling of the danger and alarm</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Into those dull, still eyes:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Then dragged him, and half-carried him, in haste,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To reach the airway, where 'twould still be sweet</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>When all the gallery was foul with gas:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But, soon as they had reached it, they were faced</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>By a big fall of roof they could not pass;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And found themselves cut off from all retreat,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>On every hand, by that black shining wall;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With naught to do but sit and wait</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Till rescue came, if rescue came at all,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And did not come too late.</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, in the fresher airway, light came back</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To Robert's eyes, although he never spoke:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And not a sound the deathly quiet broke,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>As they sat staring at that wall of black--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>As, in the glimmer of the dusky lamp,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>They sat and wondered, wondered if the damp--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The stealthy after-damp that creeping, creeping,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Takes strong lads by the throat, and drops them sleeping,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To wake no more for any woman's weeping--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Would steal upon them, ere the rescue came....</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And if the rescuers would find them sitting,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Would find them sitting cold....</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Then, as they sat and wondered, like a flame</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>One thought burned up both hearts:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Still, neither breathed her name.</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>And now their thoughts dropped back into the pit,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And through the league-long gallery went flitting</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With speed no fall could hold:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>They wondered how their mates had fared:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>If they'd been struck stone-dead,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Or if they shared</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Like fate with them, or reached the shaft,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Unhurt, and only scared,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Before disaster overtook them:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And then, although their courage ne'er forsook them,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>They wondered once again if they must sit</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Awaiting death ... but knowing well</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>That even for a while to dwell</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>On such like thoughts will drive a strong man daft:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>They shook themselves until their thoughts ran free</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Along the drift, and clambered in the cage;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And in a trice were shooting up the shaft:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But when their thoughts had come to the pithead,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And found the fearful people gathered there,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Beneath the noonday sun,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Bright-eyed with terror, blinded by despair,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Dick rose, and with his chalk wrote on the wall,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>This message for their folk:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>"We can't get any further, 12, noonday"--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And signed both names; and, when he'd done,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Though neither of them spoke,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>They both seemed easier in a way,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Now that they'd left a word,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Though nothing but a scrawl.</span>

        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>And silent still they sat,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And never stirred:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And Dick's thoughts dwelt on this and that:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>How, far above their heads, upon the sea</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The sun was shining merrily,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And in its golden glancing</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The windy waves were dancing:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And how he'd slipt that morning on his way:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And how on Friday, when he drew his pay,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He'd buy a blanket for his whippet, Nell;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He felt dead certain she would win the race,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>On Saturday ... though you could never tell,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>There were such odds against her ... but his face</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Lit up as though, even now, he saw her run,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>A little slip of lightning, in the sun:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>While Robert's thoughts were ever on the match</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>His team was booked to play on Saturday;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He placed the field, and settled who should play</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The centre-forward; for he had a doubt</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Will Burn was scarcely up to form, although...</span>

        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>Just then, the lamp went slowly out.</span>

        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>Still, neither stirred,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Nor spoke a word;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Though either's breath came quickly, with a catch.</span>

          <div class="line">

          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Set both their hearts afire</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>In one fierce flame</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Of quick desire:</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Then Dick stretched out his hand; and caught</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>His brother's arm; and whispered in his ear:</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>And then, as I drew nigh, he spoke</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With shaking head, and voice that broke:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>"I've missed you these last nights," he said</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>"And I have not so many now</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>That I can miss friends easily...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Aye: friends grow scarce, as you grow old:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And roads are rough: and winds are cold:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And when you feel you're losing hold,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Life does not go too merrily."</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And then he stood with nodding head,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And spoke no more. And so I told</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>How I had been, six days and nights,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Exiled from pleasant sounds and sights.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And now, as though my voice had stirred</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>His heart to speech, he told right out,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With quickening eye and quavering word,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The things I care to hear about,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The little things that make up life:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>How he'd been lonesome, since his wife</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Had died, some thirty year ago:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And how he trudged three mile or so</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To reach the farmstead where he worked,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And three mile back to his own door...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>For he dwelt outby on the moor:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And every day the distance irked</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>More sorely still his poor, old bones;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And all the road seemed strewn with stones</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To trip you up, when you were old--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>When you were old, and friends were few:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>How, since the farmstead had been sold,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The master and the men were new,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>All save himself; and they were young;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And Mistress had a raspy tongue:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>So, often, he would hardly speak</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>A friendly word from week to week</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With any soul. Old friends had died,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Or else had quit the countryside:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, since his wife was taken, he</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Had lived alone, this thirty year:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And there were few who cared to hear</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>An old man's jabber ... and too long</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He'd kept me, standing in the cold,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With his long tongue, and such a song</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>About himself! And I would be...</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>I put my arm through his; and turned</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To go upon his way with him:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And once again that warm light burned</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>In those old eyes, so weak and dim:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>While, with thin, piping voice, he told</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>How much it meant to him each night</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To change a kindly word with me:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To think that he'd at least one friend</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Who'd maybe miss him, in the end.</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>Then, as we walked, he said no more:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, silent, in the starry light,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Across the wide, sweet-smelling bent,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Between the grass and stars we went</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>In quiet, friendly company:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, all the way, we only heard</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>A chirrup where some partridge stirred,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And ran before us through the grass,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To hide his head till we should pass.</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>At length, we reached the cottage-door:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But, when I stopped, and turned to go,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>His words came falteringly and slow:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>If I would step inside, and rest,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I'd be right welcome: not a guest</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Had crossed his threshold, thirty year...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He'd naught but bread and cheese and beer</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To offer me ... but, I'd know best...</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>He spoke with hand upon the latch;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, when I answered, opened wide</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The cottage-door; and stepped inside;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, as I followed, struck a match,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And lit a tallow-dip: and stirred</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The banked-up peats into a glow:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And then with shuffling step and slow</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He moved about: and soon had set</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Two mugs of beer, and bread and cheese:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And while we made a meal off these,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The old man never spoke a word;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But, brooding in the ingle-seat,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With eyes upon the kindling peat,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He seemed awhile to quite forget</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He was not sitting by himself</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To-night, like any other night;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>When, as, in the dim candle-light,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I glanced around me, with surprise</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I saw, upon the rafter-shelf,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>A flute, nigh hidden in the shade.</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>And when I asked him if he played,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The light came back into his eyes:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Aye, aye, he sometimes piped a bit,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But not so often since she died.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And then, as though old memories lit</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>His poor, old heart, and made it glad,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He told how he, when quite a lad,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Had taught himself: and they would play</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>On penny whistles all the day--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He and the miller's son, beside</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The millpool, chirping all they knew,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Till they could whistle clean and true:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And how, when old enough to earn,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>They both saved up to buy a flute;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And they had played it, turn for turn:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But, Jake was dead, this long while back...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Ah! if I'd only heard him toot,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I'd know what music meant. Aye, aye...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He'd play me something, by-and-bye;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Though he was naught to Jake ... and now</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>His breath was scant, and fingering slack...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He used to play to her at night</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The melodies that she liked best,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>While she worked on: she'd never rest</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>By daylight, or by candle-light...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And then, with hand upon his brow,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He brooded, quiet in his chair,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With eyes upon the red peat-glare;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Until, at length, he roused himself,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And reached the flute down from the shelf;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, carrying it outside the door,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I saw him take a can, and pour</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Fresh water through the instrument,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To make it sweet of tone, he said.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Then, in his seat, so old and bent,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With kindling eyes, and swaying head,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He played the airs he used to play</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To please his wife, before she died:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And as I watched his body sway</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>In time and tune, from side to side,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>So happy, playing, and to please</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With old familiar melodies,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>His eyes grew brighter and more bright,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>As though they saw some well-loved sight:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, following his happy gaze,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I turned, and saw, without amaze,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>A woman standing, young and fair,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With hazel eyes, and thick brown hair</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Brushed smoothly backward from the brow,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Beside the table that but now,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Save for the empty mugs, was bare.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Upon it she had spread a sheet:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And stood there, ironing a shirt,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Her husband's, as he played to her</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Her favourite tunes, so old and sweet.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I watched her move with soundless stir;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Then stand with listening eyes, and hold</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The iron near her glowing cheek,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Lest it, too hot, should do some hurt,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And she, so careful not to burn</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The well-darned shirt, so worn and old.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Then, something seemed to make me turn</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To look on the old man again:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, as I looked, the playing stopped;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And now I saw that he had dropped</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Into his brooding mood once more,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With eyes again grown dull and weak.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He seemed the oldest of old men</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Who grope through life with sight worn dim</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, even as I looked at him,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Too full of tender awe to speak,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I knew once more the board was bare,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With no young woman standing there</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With hazel eyes and thick, brown hair;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And I, in vain, for her should seek,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>If I but sought this side death's door.</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>And so, at last, I rose, and took</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>His hand: and as he clasped mine tight,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I saw again that friendly look</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Fill his old weary eyes with light,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And wish me, without words, good-night</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And in my heart, that look glowed bright</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Till I reached home across the moor.</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, at the corner of the lane,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Next night, I heard the old voice cry</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>In greeting, as I struggled by,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Head-down against the wind and rain.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And so each night, until one day,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>His master chanced across my way:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But, when I spoke of him, he said:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Did I not know the man was dead,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And had been dead a week or so?</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>One morn he'd not turned up to work;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And never having known him shirk;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And hearing that he lived alone;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He thought it best himself to go</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And see what ailed: and coming there,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He found the old man in his chair,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Stone-dead beside the cold hearthstone.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>It must be full a week, or more...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Aye, just two weeks, come Saturday,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He'd found him; but he must have died</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>O'ernight--(the night I heard him play!)</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And they had found, dropt by his side,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>A broken flute upon the floor.</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>Yet, every night, his greeting still</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>At that same corner of the hill,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Summer and Winter, wet or dry,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>'Neath cloud, or moon, or cold starlight,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Is waiting there to welcome me:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And ever as I hurry by,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The old voice sings out cheerily:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>"Good-night!" and yet again, "Good-night!"</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
